Summary:
Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after CO2. Recent years have seen a huge increase in methane concentrations from anthropogenic sources which is an issue of concern.

Through this project we aim to estimate the global methane concentrations by using machine learning solutions and existing methane products from satellite imagery.
